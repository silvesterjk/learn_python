Features of Good Design:
1. Reuse code as much as possible.
  - At the low­est level, you reuse class­es: class libraries, con­tain­ers, maybe some class “teams” like con­tain­er/iter­a­tor.
  - Frame­works are at the high­est level. They real­ly try to dis­till your design deci­sions. They iden­ti­fy the key abstrac­tions for solv­ing a prob­lem, rep­re­sent them by class­es and define rela­tion­ships between them.
  - Design pattern could be the middle level.

2. Extensibility:
  - Allow for the code to extend to more features.

| Design Principles

1. Encapsulate what varies:
  - Identify the aspects of the app that changes and the ones that remain the same.
  - Method level: If a method that calculates the orderTotal, that can call getTaxRate method inside to calculate the tax, that way if the tax rate change, we'll only have to touch that.
  - Class level: Sometimes it is probably a good idea to seperate classes based on what it is expected to do. If a class computes all the order details class can handle all the tax related functionality.
  - Program to an interface and not an implementation. 
      * Initially, you might make one class directly dependent on another for collaboration, which is a common starting point.
      * For a more flexible approach, define an interface or abstract class detailing the necessary methods one object needs from another. 
      * Then, make the dependent class rely on this interface instead of the concrete class, allowing for interchangeable implementations.
